			<h2>Don't memorize anymore! &mdash; Reminiscor has your back</h2>
			<p class='longcopy'>Reminiscor is a minimal and easy to set-up Password Manager application which is available on Windows and Linux systems. 
			   It uses 256-bit AES encryption along with an imporved algorithm of the well known Enigma Machine to encrypt your data. 
			   It is offline and has facilities to share and backup password entries, making it secure and reliable. It's also free and open-source for
			   development.

				<h3>One for all Philosophy!</h3>
			 	<p>
			 		Use your master password to secure all your files with 256-bit AES encryption along with each individual password entry being encrypted with
			 		<i>"Enigma keys"</i> which are unique and generated during run-time. After a new entry is
			 		added another layer of enigma encryption is applied on all passwords, after which the final layer of AES encryption comes into play.
			 		The AES encryption key is derived from the master password.

				<h3>Isn't Offline inconvinient?<br></h3>
			 	<p>
			 		Some might see this as a drawback but I as a developer would like to keep my passwords only with me! Instead of trust, Reminiscor 
			 		gives you the oppurtunity to review it's security. Also it provides backup options, where all user files can be put onto a
			 		remote repository or onto storage media, to restore entries or to port them to a new device at any given time, all backup files are safe to store anywhere too.

				<h3>Can I share my passwords?<br></h3>
			 	<p>
			 		You might have the idea that sharing password entries or accounts is hard in offline password managers. Reminiscor
			 		lets you make a <i>"shared passwords file"</i> which may have one or many passwords to share around as an encrypted
			 		file with other users, which can be decrypted only with the combination of the correct usernames and common password set by
			 		you and the person(s) to share with.

				<h3>Isn't Enigma 100 years old?</h3>
			 	<p>
			 		Enigma was sophisticated, the reason it failed was because of its physical limitations. In Reminiscor the newer version of the Enigma algorithm is capable of generating upto 2 x 10<sup>457</sup> unique possible enigma keys that can encrypt all characters in the English alphabet along with numbers and special characters. This allows us to have an additional layer of security under the AES encryption which remains the outer and the most secure layer.
